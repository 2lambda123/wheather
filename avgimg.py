'''

Average images with PIL.

avgimg.py input... output

We rely on numpy for capacious but fast types to hold the running sum, 
and on PIL for reading and writing, including guessing the format you 
want from the file suffix.

Todo:
+ More docs
+ Refuse to clobber an existing output file?
+ Better error-checking in general
